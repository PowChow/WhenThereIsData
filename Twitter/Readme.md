This example demonstrates sentiment analysis of tweets by brand mentions. Text was cleaned and allocated ***Affective ratings*** from a dictionary of 14 thousand English Words. The dictionary was compiled by Amy Warriner and Victor Kuperman and can be found from this link: http://crr.ugent.be/archives/1003.  

Please choose a different `Brand` or dataset to view sentiment by tweets and output of tweet texts. 

Notice, the approach to sentiment analysis is one of the most "simple" ways to do so, by applying a positive or negative value to a list of single words. In cleaning the text, I removed uppercase, symbols, numbers, and lemmitized the words (cut off endings). In further analysis of sentiments in tweets, grouping of words (bigrams), word relationships to each other, and capitalizing should be viewed to create more accurate sentiment measures.
